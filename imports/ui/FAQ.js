            I wanted to know how busy the line to get into the supermarket is
            before adding myself to the number of people congregating and
            potentially spreading the virus.

            Why do I have to physically be at the store when adding it to the
            site?

          <p>
            This site relies on the coordinates provided by your phone. When you
            add a new store, it will use your current location as the store's
            location. When someone else updates the status of a line, it will
            check that they are really at the same location.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some other ways around this problem, but none of them are
            free and they all provide tracking data to third parties. I would
            like to avoid this exposing your information to third parties.
